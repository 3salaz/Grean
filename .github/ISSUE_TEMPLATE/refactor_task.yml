        **ðŸ›  Suggested Branch Naming Convention**
        
        Based on your input, your branch should follow this format:
        
        ```
        refactor/<scope>-<slugified-title>
        ```

        Example: `refactor/shared-cleanup-header-component`

        Use short, dash-separated keywords. If this is a fix instead of a cleanup, use `fix/` instead.
