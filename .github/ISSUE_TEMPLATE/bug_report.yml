        **üêû Suggested Branch Naming Convention**
        
        To fix this bug, create a branch named:
        
        ```
        fix/<scope>-<slugified-title>
        ```

        Example: `fix/driver-map-update-issue`

        Use short, dash-separated keywords. For refactors instead of bugs, use `refactor/` instead.
