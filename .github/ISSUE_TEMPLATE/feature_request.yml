        **ðŸª´ Suggested Branch Naming Convention**
        
        Based on your input, your branch should follow this format:
        
        ```
        feature/<scope>-<slugified-title>
        ```

        Example: `feature/client-pickup-scheduling-reminders`

        Replace `<slugified-title>` with a short, dash-separated version of your feature title.

        If this is a bug fix or refactor, use `fix/` or `refactor/` instead of `feature/`.
